Introduction:


The purpose of this repository is to share an analysis of the datasets (caseStudy2data.csv) given for the final case study 2 in Doing Data Science. This  project focused on analyzing the following questions: How can we predict attrition from this the variables given in this dataset? and how can we predict monthly income in base of the mentioned dataset? 
We aim to find the best model to predict attrition and monthly income from the given dataset.
